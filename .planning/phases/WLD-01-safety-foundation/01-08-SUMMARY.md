# Phase 1 Plan 08: Preservation-First Workspace Retention Summary

**Managed workspace inspection is fail-closed and read-only, with real deletion-path proof that user bytes remain intact.**

## Performance

- **Duration:** approximately 3 hours including successor repair and aggregate proof
- **Completed:** 2026-07-20
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files owned:** 58

## Accomplishments

- Replaced mutation-suggestive quarantine vocabulary with a non-authoritative `review-candidate` classification and removed the legacy aliases.
- Made incomplete, malformed, contradictory, unreadable, raced, invalid-date, and active-process evidence preserve by default.
- Added an encrypted installation-bound provenance ledger at the real temporary-workspace creation seam; matching filenames can no longer mint ownership.
- Bound provenance publication to the exact canonical root, canonical workspace path, device, and inode observed immediately after exclusive creation; replacing that object before ledger publication now fails closed.
- Kept CLI-safe root aliases usable by correlating canonical producer entry paths against the report's canonical root, while retaining lexical-root identity as separate evidence.
- Preserved terminating process authority until actual shutdown and made conversation removal fail closed when shutdown fails.
- Proved through the production conversation service and SQLite repository adapter that deleting a conversation severs the database reference without altering exact managed-workspace file bytes.
- Restricted the retention IPC and renderer to read-only explanations, with hostile tests rejecting renderer-supplied roots, paths, classifications, mutation verbs, aliases, and unknown fields.
- Closed the callback-time successor race: removal now re-drains refused same-ID processes after deferred persistence and fails closed when their shutdown is unproved.
- Made Windows taskkill failure and POSIX process-tree enumeration failure reject shutdown instead of silently treating missing evidence as success.
- Awaited idle-shutdown results through `Promise.allSettled`, preserving failed leases while deterministically observing every rejection.
- Prevented background wiki synthesis from treating the launch working directory as user-authorized project context, eliminating generated `.ijfw` state from aggregate proof.
- Preserved the 1,001-entry Mission Control reachability proof while removing its repeated full-accessibility-tree timeout failure under aggregate load.

1. **Conservative classifier and real deletion-path proof:** `d73fce99ea53a134b7325c3f2f50f6120532bab9`
2. **Read-only bridge and review presentation:** `56885e04cc390a6f8f48bf303808313d2bfb9cba`
3. **Adversarial authority and race repair:** `88f86216576fa70ee50c4d57fafae72f67a2b73a`
4. **Successor shutdown-proof repair:** `1037c0b82f2c6a7829a4d3b9c36e6279b1db8ee8`
5. **Alias, creation-identity, parser, and deterministic-test repair:** final handoff commit containing this summary

**Rejected predecessor:** `0b98288b02e0b65b260c7b3b1670bd5ea5b68419`

**Repaired implementation candidate:** exact commit and tree are recorded in the independent handoff because a commit cannot contain its own hash

**Aggregate-proved source tree:** final source tree recorded by that handoff

**Acceptance state:** pending independent successor re-audit; no acceptance claim is made here.

## Decisions Made

- Authority evidence is complete only when every required source has an exact recognized value and no unknown source is present.
- A review candidate remains informational: it is not a deletion, pruning, or quarantine instruction.
- Current Node filesystem observation cannot safely establish an immutable empty-directory snapshot, so current candidates remain preserved.
- The preview IPC accepts no renderer request object because the main process owns the canonical workspace root and classification evidence.

## Deviations from Plan

The independent audits reopened the plan three times. Repairs added creation provenance, immutable-snapshot fail-closed behavior, terminating-process leases, total IPC parsing, canonical authority ordering, contradictory-duplicate rejection, human-readable active-work labels, production service/repository deletion proof, callback-time successor draining, fail-closed process-tree enumeration, deterministic idle-rejection observation, canonical alias correlation, creation-time object identity, impossible phase-1 evidence rejection, and deterministic Constitution recovery observation. These changes enforce the plan's authority boundary without expanding lifecycle authority.

## Issues Encountered

The complete suite emitted pre-existing non-failing jsdom canvas, listener-count, and nested mock warnings outside this plan's owned files. All required gates completed successfully.

## Explicit Non-Claim

Managed-workspace lifecycle mutation (quarantine, restore, keep, delete, prune) is not delivered.

## Self-Check

BUILDER PROOF PASSED; independent successor re-audit remains required. The repaired implementation passed 236 focused tests, typecheck, scoped formatting, 15,200 Vitest tests, and 226 Bun-native tests. New repair lines introduced no lint findings; `initAgent.ts` retains 11 baseline `no-await-in-loop` warnings and zero errors. Aggregate proof left no generated `.ijfw/wiki-state/index.json` behind. No lifecycle mutation authority was added.
